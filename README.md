# Hey Jude Project

Hey Jude is a Java-based web application designed to help manage events and tasks for children. With its intuitive interface, it allows parents and guardians to efficiently organize activities and appointments for their kids. The app was developed during a hackathon inspired by the song "Hey Jude" by The Beatles. This song, known for its comforting and supportive message, was chosen as a theme to reflect the app's purpose of providing structure and support for families, much like the song aimed to offer solace to John Lennon's son during a difficult time.
