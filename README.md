# Hey Jude Project

Hey Jude is a Java web application designed to manage events and tasks for children. It provides a user-friendly interface for parents and guardians to organize activities and appointments for their kids.

## Introduction

Hey Jude aims to simplify the process of managing children's schedules by providing a centralized platform for parents and guardians. It allows users to create, edit, and delete events, set reminders, and collaborate with other family members.

## Future Development
Please note that this project is not fully finished. While it provides basic functionality for managing children's events, there is still room for improvement and additional features. In the future, I plan to refactor the backend code to build a more robust and scalable web application.

## Features

- Create and manage events for children.
- Add and remove parents or guardians associated with a child.
- View a list of upcoming events and tasks.
- RESTful API for integration with external systems.
- User authentication and authorization.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Framework
- Spring MVC
- Spring RESTful API
- Hibernate
- MySQL
- Thymeleaf
- Log4j2

## Problems Encountered

During the development process, I encountered an issue with the database connection. Upon investigating, I checked the Tomcat logs and identified that there was a problem with the database connection. This required troubleshooting and adjustments to ensure proper connectivity between the application and the database.
